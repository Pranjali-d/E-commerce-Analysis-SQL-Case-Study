### üë©üèª‚Äçüíº THE SITUATION

Maven Fuzzy Factory has been live for ~8 months, and your CEO is due to present company performance metrics to the board next week. You‚Äôll be the one tasked with preparing relevant metrics to show the company‚Äôs promising growth.

</br>

### ‚úèÔ∏è THE OBJECTIVE

Use SQL to:
- Extract and analyze website traffic and performance data from the Maven Fuzzy Factory database to **quantify the company‚Äôs growth**, and to tell the story of **how you have been able to generate that growth**.
- As an Analyst, the first part of your job is extracting and analyzing the data, and the next part of your job is effectively communicating the story to your stakeholders.

### üìå Q1: Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there?

- **Table:** year month | sessions | orders | session to order rate

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM s.created_at) AS yr_mth,
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/ 
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.website_session_id),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions s
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON s.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE s.created_at < '2012-11-27'
  AND s.utm_source = 'gsearch'
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM s.created_at);
```

**Insights:** Steady growth of gsearch session to order rate from 3.27% in Mar 2012 to 4.23% to Nov 2012. 

***
</br>

### üìå Q2: Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.

- **Table:** year_month | nonbrand_sessions | nonbrand_orders | nonbrand_conversion_r | brand_sessions | brand_orders | brand_conversion_r

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM s.created_at) AS yr_mth,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END),2) AS nonbrand_cvr,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END),2) AS brand_cvr
FROM website_sessions s
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON s.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE s.created_at < '2012-11-27'
  AND s.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND s.utm_campaign IN ('nonbrand', 'brand')
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM s.created_at);
```

<img width="603" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/140636838-1a81092c-a7ac-4eba-abbc-aa46493d0f3c.png">

**Insights:** Nonbrand session to order rate is steadily growing from 3.28% to 4.19%. Brand conversion rate is slightly inconsistent with highest 9.84% in Apr 2012 and recently averaging at 4-5% in late 2012. Could be due to different brands being promoted in different month or season. It would help to have further breakdown of brands in the campaign.

***
</br>

### üìå Q3: While we‚Äôre on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.

- **Table:** year_month | mobile_sessions | mobile_orders | mobile_cvr | desktop_sessions | desktop_orders | desktop_cvr

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM s.created_at) AS yr_mth,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.device_type = 'mobile' THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.device_type = 'mobile' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_orders, 
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.device_type = 'mobile' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.device_type = 'mobile' THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END),2) AS mobile_cvr,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.device_type = 'desktop' THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.device_type = 'desktop' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.device_type = 'desktop' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.device_type = 'desktop' THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END),2) AS desktop_cvr
FROM website_sessions s
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON s.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE s.created_at < '2012-11-27'
  AND s.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND s.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM s.created_at);
```

Insights: Bulk of session to orders are contributed by users on desktop devices with good growth from 4.45% in Mar 2012 to 5.04% in Nov 2021. Investigate why mobile rate is low - maybe not user-friendly or pages are not displayed properly on mobile phone browser. Consider moving bids to desktop to optimize traffic and marketing spend.

</br>

### üìå Q4: I‚Äôm worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from Gsearch. Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?

- Table: yearmonth | sessions | gsearch_session | gsearch_rate | bsearch_session | bsearch_rate

```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT utm_source,
  utm_campaign,
  http_referer
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-11-27';
```
<img width="338" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/171320004-a26391a5-bc7a-417c-a983-c28a551a8608.png">

- If source, campaign and http referral is NULL, then it is direct traffic - users type in the website link in the browser's search bar.
- If source and campaign is NULL, but there is http referral, then it is organic search - coming from search engine and not tagged with paid parameters.

```sql 
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM created_at) AS yr_mth,
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS gsearch_paid_session,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS bsearch_paid_session,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NOT NULL THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS organic_search_session,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS direct_search_session
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM created_at);
```

<img width="652" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/140637462-2180a38d-c133-4b34-839c-1c6248f2514c.png">

Insights: Gsearch traffic started out high in Mar 2012 with 98%, then slowly dropped to 70%. Bsearch traffic picked up in Aug 2012 and grow to 22% in Nov 20122. There are 10-15% null traffic. Identify what it means by null traffic.

### üìå Q5: I‚Äôd like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?

- ST request: Calculate conversion rate of orders based on sessions
- Result: yearmonth | sessions | orders | conversion_rate

```sql
SELECT
  YEAR(s.created_at) AS yr,
  MONTH(s.created_at) AS mth,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.website_session_id IS NOT NULL THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN o.order_id IS NOT NULL THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS orders, 
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN o.order_id IS NOT NULL THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN s.website_session_id IS NOT NULL THEN s.website_session_id ELSE NULL END),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions s
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON s.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE s.created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY YEAR(s.created_at), MONTH(s.created_at);
```

<img width="291" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/170808375-03f0a66c-4f2f-480b-886c-590e1ecd1625.png">

Insights: Conversion rate increased from 3.23% in March 2012 to 4.45% in November. Rates start to hit 4% in September.

### üìå Q6: For the gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us (Hint: Look at the increase in CVR from the test (Jun 19 ‚Äì Jul 28), and use nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)

- Revenue from Jun 19 ‚Äì Jul 28 vs same period

```sql
-- Find the first lander-1 website_pageview_id
SELECT
  MIN(website_pageview_id)
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE pageview_url = '/lander-1';
```

The first pageview url website_pageview_id = 23504

```sql
SELECT
  p.pageview_url AS landing_page,
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.website_session_id),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions s
INNER JOIN website_pageviews p
  ON s.website_session_id = p.website_session_id
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON s.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE p.website_pageview_id >= 23504
  AND s.created_at < '2012-07-28'
  AND s.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND s.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
  AND p.pageview_url IN ('/home', '/lander-1')
GROUP BY p.pageview_url;
``` 
<img width="297" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/170808139-e5c195bc-b9e6-4c7c-aa7f-ceb11a71a269.png">

Homepage's conversion rate is 3.11% and the new page lander-1's conversion rate is 4.14%. Incremental difference in website performance is 1.03% using lander-1.

```sql
SELECT
  MAX(s.website_session_id)
FROM website_sessions s
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews p
  ON s.website_session_id = p.website_session_id
WHERE s.created_at < '2012-11-27'
  AND s.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND s.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
  AND p.pageview_url = '/home';
-- the last website session with gsearch nonbrand paid campaign = 17145

SELECT
  COUNT(website_session_id) AS sessions_since_test
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-11-27'
  AND website_session_id > 17145 -- last home session
  AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand';
```

<img width="145" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/170808159-a39d180a-824f-47d4-bc53-f78e61386ee5.png">

**Insights:** 
- Improved total sessions using `\lander-1` = 21,729
- 21,729 x 1.03% (incremental % of order) = estimated at least 223 incremental orders since 29 Jul using `\lander-1` page
- 223/4 months = 55 additional orders per month!
- Increased performance of website and quantified the performance of the additional website sessions.

### üìå Q7: For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion funnel from each of the two pages to orders. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 ‚Äì Jul 28).

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE flagged_sessions_summary

  website_session_id,
  MAX(homepage) AS saw_homepage,
  MAX(custom_lander) AS saw_custom_lander,

  MAX(cart_page) AS cart_page_made_it,  
  MAX(shipping_page) AS shipping_page_made_it,
  MAX(billing_page) AS billing_page_made_it,  
  MAX(thankyou_page) AS thankyou_page_made_it

    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id),2) AS billing_click_rt,
  ROUND(100*COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN thankyou_page_made_it = 1 THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END)/
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id),2) AS thankyou_click_rt
FROM flagged_sessions_summary
GROUP BY segment;
```

**Insights:** Custom lander page has overall better click through rate as compared to the original homepage.

### üìå Q8: I‚Äôd love for you to quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 ‚Äì Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month to understand monthly impact.

- ST request: Calculate the sessions for `/billing` and `/billing-2` and revenue per billing page from Sep 10 ‚Äì Nov 10
- Result: billing_version | sessions (count) | revenue per billing session

```sql
-- Pull out relevant data ie. website session id, page url, order id and prices associated with the billing pages
WITH billing_revenue AS (
SELECT 
  p.website_session_id, 
  p.pageview_url AS billing_version, -- Page url associated with the website session id
  o.order_id, -- 
  o.price_usd -- Billing associated with each order id. It represents the revenue
FROM website_pageviews p
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON p.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE p.created_at BETWEEN '2012-09-10' AND '2012-11-10'
  AND p.pageview_url IN ('/billing', '/billing-2'))
```

```sql
SELECT 
  billing_version,
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions, -- 
  SUM(price_usd)/COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS revenue_per_billing_page

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(website_session_id) AS sessions

**Insights:**
- $23.04 for old '\billing' page and $31.31 for new '\billing-2' page. Lift of $8.27 per billing page view; increased by 35%.
- Over the past month, there are 1,021 sessions and with the increase of $8.27 average revenue per session, we are looking at a positive impact of $8,443.67 increase in revenue.
