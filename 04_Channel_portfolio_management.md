- **ST request:** Pull gsearch and bsearch nonbrand conversion rates from session to orders and slice by device type from 22 Aug - 18 Sep
- **Result:** device_type | utm_source | sessions | orders | conversion_rate

**Insights:** `gsearch` campaign has higher conversion rate in both desktop and mobile at 4.75% and 1.16% compared to 3.71% and 0.8% for `bsearch` campaign. Suggest to bid down on 'bsearch' campaigns.

**Insights:**
- The desktop `bsearch` sessions was consistent at 4% of `gsearch` sessions, but dropped after reduced bids on 2 December. However, it could also be impacted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and other seasonality factors. 
- As for mobile sessions, there was a sharp fall after bids were reduced, but was fluctuating throughout December, so it was hard to isolate whether it was due to reduced bids or other factors as well.
