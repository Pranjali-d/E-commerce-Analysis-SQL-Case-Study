# Analyzing Website Performances

Website content analysis is about understanding which pages are seen most by the users and to identify where to focus on improving your business.
- Identify the most common landing page and the first thing a user sees.
- For most viewed pages and common landing pages, understand how those pages perform for business objectives.
- Does the pages tell a story or resonate with business values?

In this section, we will learn about
- Analyzing top website pages and entry/landing pages
- Analyzing bounce rates and landing pages test
- Building conversion funnels and testing conversion paths

### ðŸ“Œ Q6: Identifying Top Website Pages
<img width="294" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/171318612-5344a53c-052a-4647-8e11-0c6d8e9cf215.png">

- **ST request:** Identify most viewed website pages ranked by session volume
- **Result:** pageview_url | sessions (count)
- **Steps:** Find page view count by page view url, filter date < 2012-06-09 and sort session count descencing

```sql
SELECT 
  pageview_url, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_pageview_id) AS page_views
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-09'
GROUP BY pageview_url
ORDER BY page_views DESC;
```

- **Insights:** Most viewed pages with highest traffic are **homepage, products, and original Mr Fuzzy**. Is traffic for top landing pages the same?

***

### ðŸ“Œ Q7: Identifying Top Entry Pages
<img width="295" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/171318667-f31c2781-c7fd-4cbe-821a-8a1a085cfa6c.png">

Entry/landing page is the page where customer lands on website for the first time.
- **ST request:** Pull a list of top entry pages
- **Result:** landing_page_url | landing_page_count
- **Steps:** Filter date to < 2012-06-12

```sql
WITH landing_page_cte AS (
SELECT
  website_session_id,
  MIN(website_pageview_id) AS landing_page_count -- Find the first page landed for each session
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at < '2012-06-12'
GROUP BY website_session_id
)

SELECT 
  wp.pageview_url AS landing_page_url,
  COUNT(DISTINCT lp.website_session_id) AS count
FROM landing_page_cte lp
LEFT JOIN website_pageviews wp
  ON lp.landing_page = wp.website_pageview_id
GROUP BY wp.pageview_url
ORDER BY landing_page_url DESC;
```

- **Insights:** Home page is the top landing page. What other metrics can we use to analyse landing page performance? How do we know the metric can appropriately judge whether a page is performing well or not?
- **Possible metrics:** Repeat sessions? Which day and time most viewed? By source, campaign, device type?

## Landing Page Performance and Testing

### ðŸ“Œ Q8: Calculating Bounce Rates
<img width="296" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/171318738-a557166e-97bb-432b-be56-6b005e85e4b5.png">

Now that we have the sessions for the landing pages, let's find out their bounce rate.

We breakdown the steps to get a clear picture of what we're trying to find.
- **Result:** landing page | sessions (count) | bounced sessions (count) | bounced rate
- **Step 1:** Find the first `website_pageview_id` or landing page for associated session
- **Step 2:** Count page views for each session to identify bounces
- **Step 3:** Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions and calculate bounce rate

```sql
-- Step 1: Find first website_pageview_id/landing page for associated session and filter to date < 2012-06-14 and '\home'
WITH landing_page_cte AS (
SELECT 
  p.website_session_id,
  MIN(p.website_pageview_id) AS first_landing_page_id,
  p.pageview_url AS landing_page -- page view of first landing page
FROM website_pageviews p
INNER JOIN website_sessions s
  ON p.website_session_id = s.website_session_id
  AND s.created_at < '2012-06-14'
WHERE p.pageview_url = '/home' 
GROUP BY p.website_session_id
),

```sql
- Step 3: Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions
SELECT

### ðŸ“Œ Q9: Analyzing Landing Page Tests
<img width="291" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/171319348-c663000e-69b4-4c89-8193-a48c9853675c.png">

ST is running a A/B test on `\lander-1` and `\home` for `gsearch nonbrand` campaign and would like to find out the bounce rates for both pages.
- **Criteria:** Limit time period to when `\lander-1` started receiving traffic and limit results to < 2012-07-28 to ensure fair comparison.
- **Result:** landing_page | total sessions | bounced sessions | bounce rate
- **Step 1:** Find when `/lander-1` was created and first displayed to user on the website. Use either date or pageview id to limit the results.
- **Step 2:** Find first landing page and filter to test time period (after '2012-06-19') and as prescribed by ST (before '2012-07-28') for gsearch and nonbrand campaign.
- **Step 3:** Count page views for each session to identify bounces
- **Step 4:** Summarize total sessions and bounced sessions and calculate bounce rate

**Insights:** Looks like the newly created `/lander-1`'s traffic has improved and bounce rate has reduced too, meaning fewer customers has bounced on the page.  

**Next steps:** Ensure that all new campaigns are directed to the new lander-1 page and monitor the bounce rates.

- **Criteria:** Email received on 31 Aug 2021, so limit results between 2012-06-01 to 2012-08-31

## Analyzing and Testing Conversion Funnels
Conversion funnel analysis is about understanding and optimizing each step of user's experience on their journey towards purchasing our products.

**Homepage > Product Page > Add to Cart > Sale**

- Identify most common paths customers take before purchasing our products.
- Identify how many of the users continue to the next step in the conversion funnel and how many users abandon at each step.
- Optimize critical pain points where users are abandoning so that you can convert more users and sell more products.

- **ST request:** ST developed a new `/billing-2` page and wants to test the traffic and billing to order conversion rate of both pages.
