## 👩🏻‍💼 THE SITUATION

Cindy is close to securing Maven Fuzzy Factory’s next round of funding, and she needs your help to tell a compelling story to investors. You’ll need to pull the relevant data, and help your CEO craft a story about a data-driven company that has been producing rapid growth.

## 📈 THE OBJECTIVE

Extract and analyze **traffic and website performance data** to craft a **growth story** that your CEO can sell. Dive in to the **marketing channel activities and the website improvements** that have contributed to your success to date, and use the opportunity to flex your analytical skills for the investors while you’re at it.

As an Analyst, the first part of your job is extracting and analyzing the data. The next (equally important) part is **communicating the story effectively to your stakeholders.**

### 📌 Q1: First, I’d like to show our volume growth. Can you pull overall session and order volume, trended by quarter for the life of the business? Since the most recent quarter is incomplete, you can decide how to handle it.

### 📌 Q6: Let’s dive deeper into the impact of introducing new products. Please pull monthly sessions to the /products page, and show how the % of those sessions clicking through another page has changed over time, along with a view of how conversion from /products to placing an order has improved.

### 📌 Q7: We made our 4th product available as a primary product on December 05, 2014 (it was previously only a cross-sell item). Could you please pull sales data since then, and show how well each product cross-sells from one another?

### 📌 Q8: In addition to telling investors about what we’ve already achieved, let’s show them that we still have plenty of gas in the tank. Based on all the analysis you’ve done, could you share some recommendations and opportunities for us going forward? No right or wrong answer here – I’d just like to hear your perspective!
