## Analysis for Channel Portfolio Management

Analyzing a portfolio of marketing channels is about bidding efficiently and using data to maximise the effectiveness of your marketing budget.
- Understanding which marketing channels are driving the most sessions and orders through your website.
- Understanding differences in user characteristics and conversion performance across marketing channels.
- Optimising bids and allocating marketing spend across multi-channel portfolio to achieve marketing performance.

- **ST request:** Pull weekly sessions from 22 Aug to 29 Nov for gsearch and bsearch
- **Result:** weekly | gsearch_sessions | bsearch_sessions

**Insights:** Conversion rate is showing a consistent 3x impact of new bsearch campaign over original gsearch campaigns in the past 3 months. 

### üìå Q14: Comparing Channel Characteristics

<img width="293" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/171320158-e1cef2d3-93bc-4322-827b-1ae3ae6874cc.png">

**Insights:** `gsearch` campaign has higher conversion rate in both desktop and mobile at 4.75% and 1.16% compared to 3.71% and 0.8% for `bsearch` campaign. Suggest to bid down on 'bsearch' campaigns.

**Insights:**
- The desktop `bsearch` sessions was consistent at 4% of `gsearch` sessions, but dropped after reduced bids on 2 December. However, it could also be impacted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and other seasonality factors. 
- As for mobile sessions, there was a sharp fall after bids were reduced, but was fluctuating throughout December, so it was hard to isolate whether it was due to reduced bids or other factors as well.
